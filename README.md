## CyberGuard

CyberGuard is a cybersecurity application designed to help users detect and analyze potential threats by monitoring and evaluating digital activity in a structured way.
It has been developed as a final-year project to demonstrate practical skills in building security-focused software, combining analysis, visualization, and reporting features.

## Features

- Real-time or scheduled analysis of security-related data (logs, inputs, or events, depending on how you configure the project).
- Dashboard-style interface to view important information such as alerts, summaries, and key metrics.
- Reporting or export functionality to help present findings during demos or evaluations.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (update this if you use React, Bootstrap, etc.).
- Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (update according to your actual implementation).
- Database: MySQL / MongoDB or any other database you used for storing data and logs.
- Other: Any additional tools, libraries, or APIs you used for security analysis or visualizations.

## System Architecture

CyberGuard follows a simple layered architecture with a user interface, backend logic, and a database or storage layer.
Users interact with the UI, which sends requests to the backend to process data, run security logic, and fetch results from the database for display.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run CyberGuard on your system.

### Prerequisites

- Operating system: Windows / Linux / macOS.
- Installed software: Git, Python or Node.js (depending on your stack), and a suitable database like MySQL or MongoDB.
- An IDE or code editor such as VS Code.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:  
   - `git clone https://github.com/parikshith832/CyberGaurd.git`  
   - `cd CyberGaurd`  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment or project environment if required (for example, using `venv` for Python or `npm` for Node.js).
3. Install dependencies:  
   - For Python projects: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
   - For Node.js projects: `npm install`

### Running the project

- Start the backend server using the command you configured, for example:  
  - Python: `python app.py` or `python main.py`  
  - Node.js: `npm start` or `npm run dev`
- Open the application in your browser at the URL shown in the terminal, commonly `http://localhost:5000` or `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Open CyberGuard in your browser and log in or access the main dashboard if no login is required.
- Use the available options to load or monitor data, review alerts or findings, and view summaries or reports that can be shown during your project demo.

## Dataset / Rules

If CyberGuard uses any datasets, rule sets, or custom logic for detection, describe them briefly in comments or documentation inside the project.
Public datasets or references can be added as links in the code or additional documentation files without reproducing copyrighted material.

## Project Status

This project is completed for final-year evaluation but can be extended with more features and optimizations.
You can continue improving detection accuracy, UI design, and performance based on feedback from users or evaluators.

## Future Work

- Add more detailed analytics and visualizations for security events.
- Integrate with external APIs or tools such as SIEM or threat intelligence feeds.
- Improve authentication, authorization, and role-based access control if applicable.

## Learnings

During the development of CyberGuard, work has been done across areas like backend development, basic security concepts, database design, and user interface creation.
The project also provided experience in using GitHub for version control, collaboration, and presenting work professionally.
